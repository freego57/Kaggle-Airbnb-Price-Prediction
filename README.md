Those who end up renting the property share their experiences through reviews. The dataset contains information on 90 variables related to the property, host, and reviews for over 35,000 Airbnb rentals in New York.
2. Goals:Construct a model using the dataset supplied and use it to predict the price of a set of Airbnb rentals included in scoringData.csv.
3. Metric: Submissions will be evaluated based on RMSE (root mean squared error) (Wikipedia). Lower the RMSE, better the model.
4. Methods: I used machine learning algorithms includes linear regression, decision tree, randomForest, boosting, etc.
